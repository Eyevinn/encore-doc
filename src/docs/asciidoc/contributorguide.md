## The Contributor Guide

We gratefully accept contributions via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well as others who are interested in this solution.

### Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request.
This is often called the [Fork-and-Pull model](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

* All contributions to this project will be released under the inbound=outbound norm, that is,
they are submitted under the projects main license.
* By submitting a pull request or filing a bug, issue, or
feature request, you agree to comply with this waiver of copyright interest.
Details can be found in the [EUPL 1.2 or later](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-text-eupl-12).
* All new code should have associated unit
tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
* Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.

### Sign-off and optionally Sign each Commit

As part of filing a pull request you agree to the DCO, [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

A DCO is a lightweight way for a contributor to confirm that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit code or documentation to a project.

To confirm that you agree to the DCO, you need to **sign off** your commits when sending us a pull request.
Technically, this is done by supplying the `-s`/`--signoff` flag to git when committing:

`$ git commit -s -m "add fix for the bug"`

Optionally, you can also sign the commit with `-S` which also gives your commit a nice verified button on GitHub,
but, it requires that you have a GPG keypair set up.

For mor information, see [Sign commit on GitHub with GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits)

`$ git commit -s -S -m "add fix for the bug"`

For the difference in signoff and signing, see
[Git signoff vs signing](https://medium.com/@MarkEmeis/git-commit-signoff-vs-signing-9f37ee272b14/)

### Git History

In order to maintain a high software quality standard, contributions should aim to follow these rules:

* We pay more attention to the quality of commit messages.
In general, we share the view on how commit messages should be written with
[the Git project itself](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches):
* [Make separate commits for logically separate changes.](https://github.com/git/git/blob/e6932248fcb41fb94a0be484050881e03c7eb298/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L43)
For example, pure formatting changes that do not affect software behaviour usually do not belong in the same commit as changes to program logic.
* [Describe your changes well.](https://github.com/git/git/blob/e6932248fcb41fb94a0be484050881e03c7eb298/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L101)
Do not just repeat in prose what is "obvious" from the code, but provide a rationale explaining _why_ you believe your change is necessary.
* [Describe your changes in the imperative.](https://github.com/git/git/blob/e6932248fcb41fb94a0be484050881e03c7eb298/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L133)
Instead of writing "Fixes an issue with transcoding" prefer "Fix an transcoding issue". Think about it like the commit only does something _if_ it is applied.
This usually results in more concise commit messages.
* [We are picky about whitespaces.](https://github.com/git/git/blob/e6932248fcb41fb94a0be484050881e03c7eb298/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L95)
Trailing whitespace and duplicate blank lines are simply a superfluous annoyance, and most Git tools flag them red in the diff anyway.

Have a look at basically any of [Jeff Kingâ€™s commits](https://github.com/git/git/commits?author=peff) in the Git project.

Thank you for reading and happy contributing!
